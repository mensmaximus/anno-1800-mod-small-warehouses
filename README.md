## About this mod

The mod adds a couple of warehouses with a smaller footprint (1x2, 2x2 and 3x3) than the vanilla warehouses (5x5). The small warehouses have alternative skins and multiple ground plates (decals). They are buildable directly, have different amounts of loading ramps plus some more features.
